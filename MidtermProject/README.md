### MIDTERM 

To practice relevant skills covered within the first half of MLBA, design and implement a textbook passage classifier that determines
whether a textbook section is 'relevant' or 'irrelevant' to a practice exam. 

## Steps:

- 1. Datamine and preprocess textbook contents

- 2. Employ exploratory data analysis and dimension reduction

- 3. Create a labeled dataset that enabled supervised learning of 
    - k-Nearest Neighbors (Ch. 7)
    - Naive Bayes (Ch. 8)
    - Classification and Regression Trees (Ch. 9)
    - Logistic Regression (Ch. 10) if covered.

- 4. Evaluate model performance
